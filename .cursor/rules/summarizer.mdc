API functions
The create() function lets you configure a new summarizer object to your needs. It takes an optional options object with the following parameters:

sharedContext: Additional shared context that can help the summarizer.
type: The type of the summarization, with the allowed values key-points (default), tl;dr, teaser, and headline.
format: The format of the summarization, with the allowed values markdown (default), and plain-text.
length: The length of the summarization, with the allowed values short, medium (default), and long. The meanings of these lengths vary depending on the type requested. For example, in Chrome's implementation, a short key-points summary consists of three bullet points, and a short summary is one sentence; a long key-points summary is seven bullet points, and a long summary is a paragraph.

The following example demonstrates how to initialize the summarizer.
const options = {
  sharedContext: 'This is a scientific article',
  type: 'key-points',
  format: 'markdown',
  length: 'medium',
};

const available = (await self.ai.summarizer.capabilities()).available;
let summarizer;
if (available === 'no') {
  // The Summarizer API isn't usable.
  return;
}
if (available === 'readily') {
  // The Summarizer API can be used immediately .
  summarizer = await self.ai.summarizer.create(options);
} else {
  // The Summarizer API can be used after the model is downloaded.
  summarizer = await self.ai.summarizer.create(options);
  summarizer.addEventListener('downloadprogress', (e) => {
    console.log(e.loaded, e.total);
  });
  await summarizer.ready;
}
